    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>I grew up with a healthy affection for sautéed greens: Bright, vibrant, spiked with garlic and red pepper and maybe a little citrus at the end.</p>
    <p>This was how greens were supposed to be served—alive, vigorous, and most of all, emerald green. So you can imagine my shock when I first encountered Southern-style collard greens.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons bacon fat, lard, or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced from root to tip</li>
        <li>1 ham hock</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
        <li>1 to 2 cups water</li>
        <li>8 to 10 cups (about 2 pounds) stemmed, cleaned, and chopped collard greens</li>
        <li>Kosher salt to taste</li>
        <li>Vinegar and hot sauce to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the onions in bacon fat:<br>
            Heat the bacon fat in a large pot set over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion in the bacon fat, stirring often, until the edges begin to brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ham hock, garlic, chicken stock and water:<br>
            Add the ham hock, smashed garlic, chicken stock, and water, and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Add the collard greens:<br>
            Add the collard greens and cook, partially covered, until they are tender, another 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li>Chop the meat, add to the greens:<br>
            To serve, remove the ham hock, pull the meat off the bones, and chop. Mix the meat back with the greens.</li>
        <li>Season the collards, then serve:<br>
            Taste and season with salt, if needed. Serve with vinegar and hot sauce at the table.</li>
    </ol>
