    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>An old-fashioned, deep south sweet potato pie thatâ€™s creamy, delicious and full of flavor. Using brown butter and a hint of citrus to kick it up a notch without losing that old school flavor!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Pie Crust</li>
        <li>2 lb sweet potatos washed & dried</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ginger</li>
        <li>tiny pinch clove <em>optional</em></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons orange or pineapple juice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 F</li>
        <li>Pierce sweet potatoes with a fork several times</li>
        <li>Place on foil-lined baking sheet</li>
        <li>Bake for 45 minutes or until very tender</li>
        <li>Let cool while preparing the brown butter</li>
        <li>To make the brown butter, add butter to a heavy-bottom skillet over medium heat</li>
        <li>Once butter has melted it will begin to foam a bit, whisk continuously while scraping the bottom of the pan</li>
        <li>The butter will begin to turn golden and form golden brown bits on the bottom of the pan, keep whisking</li>
        <li>Once the aromas become nutty (almost like the smell of caramel) and the solids in the bottom of the pan are golden brown remove from heat</li>
        <li>Pour into a glass dish (including the brown solids) and set aside to let cool</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, scoop out the flesh of the cooled sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>Mix until creamy and smooth, adding a few splashes of water(or milk) until you have the texture of a very thick puree. (don't get it too watery, just use enough water to make mixing easier)</li>
        <li>Mix in the cooled brown butter until smooth</li>
        <li>Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, evaporated milk, eggs (see note before adding), vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove (if using), juice, and flour until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour into pie crust shell and smooth the top</li>
        <li>Preheated oven 350 F. and bake for 55 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool completely until the middle is firmly set</li>
        <li>Refrigerate until ready to serve. (You can absolutely serve it warm, but I like for it to sit in the fridge for a few hours for a denser, creamier texture.)</li>
    </ol>
